What's been keeping me busy these past few weeks?

It's been an eventful past few weeks since I launched Through Data Lens blog. Aside from starting Through Data Lens, I also wanted to take the as opportunity to gain new data science skills. Data science is constantly evolving and as such, a data scientist's skills must continuously adapt as well. With this in mind, I decided to invest my time on learning a new skill that is currently popular and would most likely remain relevant for years to come. I settled on cloud computation, specifically, AWS (Amazon Web Services).

AWS is the most widely adopted cloud platform courtesy of Amazon. They offer a variety of services such as servers, storage, networking and security to name a few. It represents a third of the cloud computing market compared to it's next three closest competitors which combined account for a third of the market as well. This gives AWS a slight edge when deciding which cloud computing software to invest time in.  

There are many certifications available for AWS, however, since my focus is primarily on data science and machine learning, I decided to begin with the [Solutions Architect (Associate Level)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certification to gain experience solving problems and implementing solutions within the AWS ecosystem and then progress towards the [Machine Learning Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/) certification.

To get started, I've enrolled in the [Ultimate AWS Solutions Architect Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/) on Udemy. Thus far, this course has provided plenty of hands on opportunities to familiarize myself with the AWS ecosystem while sill being budget friendly. As a disclaimer, aside from the course, using AWS will come with out of pocket costs however, this course does a great job a keeping those costs down and even helps you set up a notification system in case your personalized budget starts reaching a set threshold.

Stay tuned as I provide updates on my progress through these courses and prepare for the certification exam!
