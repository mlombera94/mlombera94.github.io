With the new year just around the corner, I decided to embark on a new journey to explore the world of data science and share my thoughts on the field. Along with discussing the latest in data science, this blog will also serve as a way to share previous projects and resources for those interested in learning more about data science. Follow me as we all continue to move forward from what has been a rough year for many and look to the future through a different set of lens, dare I say, data lens.
