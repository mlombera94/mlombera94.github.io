### Mathematic Courses
- MATH 105A - Real Analysis: The basic concepts of one-variable calculus are treated rigorously. Set theory, the real number system, numerical sequences and series, continuity, differentiation.
- MATH 100 - Intro Proof & Problem Solving: Introduction to sets, relations, elementary mathematical logic, proof by contradiction, mathematical induction, and counting arguments.
- MATH 23B - Vector Calculus: Double integral, changing the order of integration. Triple integrals, maps of the plane, change of variables theorem, improper double integrals. Path integrals, line integrals, parametrized surfaces, area of a surface, surface integrals. Green's theorem, Stokes' theorem, conservative fields, Gauss' theorem. Applications to physics and differential equations, differential forms.
- MATH 23A - Vector Calculus: Vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The inner and cross products. The derivative of functions from n-dimensional to m-dimensional Euclidean space is studied as a linear transformation having matrix representation. Paths in 3-dimensions, arc length, vector differential calculus, Taylor's theorem in several variables, extrema of real-valued functions, constrained extrema and Lagrange multipliers, the implicit function theorem.
- MATH 21 - Linear Algebra: Systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants. Introduction to abstract vector spaces, linear transformation, inner products, geometry of Euclidean space, and eigenvalues.
- MATH 11B - Calculus with Applications: Starting with the fundamental theorem of calculus and related techniques, the integral of functions of a single variable is developed and applied to problems in geometry, probability, physics, and differential equations. Polynomial approximations, Taylor series, and their applications
- MATH 11A - Calculus with Applications: A modern course stressing conceptual understanding, relevance, and problem solving. The derivative of polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric functions of a single variable is developed and applied to a wide range of problems involving graphing, approximation, and optimization. 

### Statistic Courses
- AMS 147 - Computational Methods and Applications: Applications of computational methods to solving mathematical problems using Matlab. Topics include solution of nonlinear equations, linear systems, differential equations, sparse matrix solver, and eigenvalue problems.
- AMS 131 - Introduction to Probability Theory: Introduction to probability theory and its applications. Combinatorial analysis, axioms of probability and independence, random variables (discrete and continuous), joint probability distributions, properties of expectation, Central Limit Theorem, Law of Large Numbers, Markov chains.
- AMS 7 - Statistical Methods (Biological, Environmental, and Health Sciences): Case-study-based introduction to statistical methods as practiced in the biological,  environmental, and health sciences. Descriptive methods, experimental design, probability, interval estimation, hypothesis testing, one- and two-sample problems, power and sample size calculations, simple correlation and simple linear regression, one-way analysis of variance, categorical data analysis.

### Economic Courses
- ECON 197 - Economic Rhetoric: Using Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence in Arguing Policy: Effectively communicate economic theory and evidence relating to economic policy to audiences that do not have economics degrees. The skills to be learned are both written and oral communication. Students learn to present convincing policy arguments in position papers, executive summaries, and in oral presentation that may include charts and other means of communication.
