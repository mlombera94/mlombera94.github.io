My name is Maurisio Lombera. I graduated from CSU East Bay in 2016 with an [M.S. in Statistics](https://catalog.csueastbay.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=9974) and a concentration in Data Science. Prior to completing my masters, I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2012 with a [B.S. in Mathematics & Economics](https://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/majors-minor/econ-math.html) as a combined major.

Currently, I work at Tesla as a Data Annotation Specialist working with raw video data used to train neural networks for the [Autopilot Program](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot). 

Before joining the Autopilot team at Tesla, I had the opportunity to work at [Gilead Sciences](https://www.gilead.com) as a Data Analyst Intern in the IT R&D Department. There, I collaborated across various departments to asses Gilead's forecasting capabilities. Using machine learning techniques and time series analysis, I demonstrated how Gilead could cut costs for example via permanent reduction at batch level and streamlined production as result of improved demand forecasting. 

Following the internship at Gilead, I was onboarded as a contract worker on the IT Solutions Development Department as a full time Data Analyst to continue working on and finish the project I began during the internship. During my tenure at Gilead, I managed and lead a project focused on analyzing the benefits of integrating statistics into demand planning and supply chain processes. This involved working with Gilead's entire historical demand data for all their products, using machine learning techniques to train and test various time series models, creating dashboards and data visualization to quickly capture differences between robust statistical models vs. non-statistical models, and creating a framework to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning concepts within the demand planning/supply chain departments. 

During my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, training in kickboxing, and going on hikes with my dog Coco. If you would like to learn more about my work background, please visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maulombera/). Look forward to connecting!
