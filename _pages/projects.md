 **Summary:**
This R-shiny application was developed to allows users to forecast monthly demand of products by applying various time series models and comparing the performance of each model. There are four main functions of this application including:
- Uploading raw demand data in a csv format and filtering data
- Single SKU forecasts and visualization
- Batch SKU forecasts
- Statistical analysis/visualization

To view more information about the application, visit the github page and if you're interested in testing the application, visit the shinyapp.io page where the application is hosted.
